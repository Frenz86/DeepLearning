Pre-training:**\n","\n","- GPT-2 is initially pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data. During pre-training, the model learns to predict the next word in a sentence given the previous words. This process enables the model to learn contextual information and patterns from the input text.\n","\n","**3. Attention Mechanism:**\n","\n","- GPT-2's self-attention mechanism allows it to weigh the importance of each word/token in relation to others. This enables the model to understand the relationships between words regardless of their position in the sequence.\n","\n","**4. Fine-tuning and Adaptation:**\n","\n","- After pre-training, GPT-2 can be fine-tuned on specific tasks by providing task-specific training data. This process adapts the model to perform well on tasks like text completion, question answering, or text generation.\n","\n","**5. Text Generation:**\n","\n","- To generate text, GPT-2 takes an initial input (prompt) and generates new text by predicting the next word/token based on the context of the input and the words it has already generated.
